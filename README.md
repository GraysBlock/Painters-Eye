Beginning in Minecraft 1.19.4, you could get a painting item that places a specific variant from the Creative Mode Inventory rather than having to keep replacing the paintings you place trying to get the right one. The only issue with this was that every painting had the same texture, making it very tedious to find the right one you needed.

"Painter's Eye" is a small resource pack that fixes that issue by giving each painting a unique texture, making it easier to find the specific painting you want. It's very light-weight, follows Jappa's art style, and includes texture for the new paintings in 1.21.

I don't actively use any main social media accounts nor do I own an account for donations, but if you want to support me you can always check out my YouTube channel. I like to make content on Minecraft and other games I enjoy, and sometimes stream games I'm playing with my friends. There's also my Planet Minecraft page, where I've released another popular resource pack called "Better Trims" that makes trimmed armor more accessible. If any of that interests you, then check out the links below!
